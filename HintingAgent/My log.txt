        VirtualErland (5:27:08 PM): Welcome, Barbara I'm Virtual Erland. In this activity, we’ll reflect on the lectures from current week, and discuss some of the core ideas.

        VirtualErland (5:27:10 PM):  Before new medicines were regulated by government agencies, many drugs were either unsafe or of questionable benefit.  How does the modern regulatory process ensure the quality of approved drugs?

        VirtualErland (5:27:34 PM): Hi all
        VirtualErland (5:27:57 PM): (gaurav) I'm Gaurav
        VirtualErland (5:28:09 PM): Why does the modern drug regulatory process result in better drugs in the market

        VirtualErland (9:26:10 PM): Welcome, undefined I'm Virtual Erland. In this activity, we’ll reflect on the lectures from current week, and discuss some of the core ideas.

        VirtualErland (9:26:12 PM):  In week 1, we discussed target-based and phenotype-based drug discovery approaches.  Why is x-ray crystallography very helpful to target-based drug discovery?

        undefined (9:26:24 PM): Hello
        undefined (9:26:30 PM): Question
        undefined (9:26:35 PM): ?
        undefined (9:26:43 PM): Something?
        undefined (9:26:51 PM): annotations
        VirtualErland (9:27:10 PM): How does information from the x-ray structure of a protein help the design of a molecule that will bind the same protein?
        VirtualErland (9:28:10 PM):  All enzyme inhibitors block the catalytic action of an enzyme, but not all inhibitors act in the same way.  Two types of inhibitors are competitive and non-competitive inhibitors.  Competitive inhibitors for a specific enzyme tend to look similar.  Non-competitive inhibitors for a specific enzyme may have almost no similarities.  Why do competitive inhibitors for an enzyme tend to have closely related structures?

        VirtualErland (9:29:10 PM): Why do competitive inhibitors for a given enzyme have similar structures, but non-competitive inhibitors can be structurally very different?
        VirtualErland (9:30:10 PM):  Bringing a drug to the market is very expensive.  Discovering a lead is inexpensive in comparison to testing in the clinic.  Discuss the factors that make clinical trials more expensive.

        VirtualErland (9:31:11 PM): How does a weak partial agonist block potential receptor response in the same way as a competitive antagonist?

        VirtualErland (9:42:54 PM):  Compounds with smaller Kd, EC50, Ki, or IC50 values are preferred in a drug discovery program.  Why would it be advantageous for a drug to have as high a potency as possible?

        VirtualErland (9:43:54 PM): Why would having a high potency minimize the possible off-target binding of a drug?
        VirtualErland (9:44:54 PM):  And now we’re done. Thanks for joining us, have a great day! I will now continue the chat activity again starting from the first prompt for those who missed the initial prompts.

        VirtualErland (1:06:52 PM):  Lipinski's rules introduce many structural features that can influence whether a drug might be orally available.  Discuss why the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors might affect oral absorption.

        undefined (1:06:53 PM): HI
        VirtualErland (1:07:19 PM): (Oz) What is this about
        VirtualErland (1:07:51 PM): How might a drug's having a large number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors prevent it from crossing cell membranes in the digestive tract?
        VirtualErland (1:08:51 PM):  The rate of blood flow through the liver and kidneys of a 70-kg patient is very high at 66 L/h and 99 L/h.  The high rate of blood flow explains the important role of these organs on drug clearance.  The blood flow rate through the lung is much higher at 314 L/h.  Why do you think the lungs, despite their high blood flow, do not normally factor into drug clearance?

        VirtualCarolyn (2:04:37 PM): I can't do this on my own :-)
        BB (2:04:52 PM): LET'S DISCUSS ABOUT low pressure precipitation
        VirtualCarolyn (2:04:53 PM):                 Will you like to answer some questions related to low pressure and precipitation ?

        BB (2:04:59 PM): Yup
        VirtualCarolyn (2:05:01 PM): Let's get started.
        VirtualCarolyn (2:05:03 PM): We can talk about low pressure and precipitation in a little more detail.
        VirtualCarolyn (2:05:03 PM): Can you explain why the chance of precipitation is most likely higher at a low pressure center?
        VirtualCarolyn has shared an image/URL. (2:05:13 PM)
        VirtualCarolyn (2:05:19 PM): Also discuss among yourselves where all of you would expect to find the coolest temperatures over the area of the map on right of your screen.
        VirtualCarolyn (2:06:02 PM): It sounds like you could use some help.
        VirtualCarolyn (2:06:02 PM): Sorry, I didn't understand you. In a low pressure center, the air is pushed upwards. Why do you think the chance of precipitation is higher at a low pressure center?
        Barbara (2:06:10 PM): I think region H will be the coolest
        VirtualCarolyn (2:06:32 PM): Do you agree or disagree with Barbara? Why, or why not?
        VirtualCarolyn (2:06:34 PM): Can you say more about that, Barbara?
        BB (2:07:01 PM): I don't agree
        VirtualCarolyn (2:07:02 PM): Let me help you out. In a low pressure center, the air is pushed upwards and condenses, so there is more moisture and clouds. This increases the chance of precipitation.
        VirtualCarolyn (2:07:02 PM): Please feel free to continue discussing among yourselves.
        VirtualCarolyn (2:07:04 PM): Got it
        Barbara (2:07:38 PM): Increased precipitation will lower the temperatur

        VirtualCarolyn (2:19:22 PM): It sounds like you're on the right track. Wind is stronger and counter-clockwise at a low pressure center.
